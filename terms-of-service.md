Please read these Terms carefully before using our website Application or Service. By using or accessing any part of the Website, Application or ordering products via the Application (whether now or in the future), you agree to be bound by these Terms. We reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time by changing them on this page.

The personal information you provide via the Application will be collected, used, managed and disclose in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

## CheaprEats

These Terms are between you and 10792195 Canada Inc. (“CheaprEats”) which is a company registered in Ontario, Canada with offices located at 256 Doris Avenue, Suite 207, Toronto, ON, Canada, M2N 6X8. When used in these Terms, the terms “us”, “we” and “our” refer to CheaprEats.

## OUR SERVICES

We provide information and a way for you to communicate your orders ("Orders") for products or services ("Products") from third party restaurants ("Restaurants"), which may be requested through the use of an application supplied by CheaprEats and downloaded and installed by you on your single mobile device (smartphone) ("the Application"). All services provided by CheaprEats to you by means of your use of the Application are hereafter referred to as the "Service".

## OUR ROLE

CheaprEats is a platform only to connect you to Restaurants, does not provide the Products or operate any of the Restaurants, and is not itself a restaurant. The provision of the Product and fulfilment of any Orders by the Restaurant to you is subject to the agreement (to be) entered into between you and the Restaurant. CheaprEats shall never be a party to such agreement. It is up to the Restaurant to accept Orders for Products and services, which may be requested through the use of the Application or the Service. CheaprEats only acts as an intermediary between you and the Restaurants, acting as the agent for each Restaurant to arrange and conclude your Orders. When you pay for an Order on the Application or Service this extinguishes your debt owed to the Restaurant for that Order.

The Application allows you to send Orders to Restaurants. The Restaurant has sole and complete discretion to accept or reject each Order.

CheaprEats encourages all our Restaurants to accept all Orders and to communicate any rejection promptly, and CheaprEats will notify you as soon as reasonably practicable if a Restaurant rejects your Order. Restaurants have the discretion to reject Orders at any time because they are too busy, due to weather conditions or for any other reason. If the Restaurant accepts a request, the Application notifies you and provides an estimate on when your Order will be ready. Neither CheaprEats nor the Restaurant guarantee that Orders will be ready for pick-up within the estimated times.
