How we use your information
CheaprEats uses the information it collects for the following purposes:
* Provide our service to you: CheaprEats uses the information we collect to provide,
maintain, personalize, and improve our products. We will use your information to:
  * Create and manage your account. This includes using your phone number or email
address to verify your identity.
  * Show you restaurants near you. We use your location to allow you to view the
Restaurants in your area. Your location also allows us to provide a walk distance and
to determine when an order should be placed.
  * Facilitate order fulfilment and pick up. If you place an order via CheaprEats, your
order and profile information is shared with our restaurant partner for the purpose of
fulfilling your order in accordance with our contract with you. This includes a photo, if
you have chosen to upload one. The Restaurant that is fulfilling your order uses this
photo to verify your identity. The Restaurant may also receive information about your
company and team, if you have chosen to join a team.
  * Process or facilitate payments.
  * Enable the various features of our product for our legitimate interests where we have
considered that these are not overridden by your rights. For example, personalization
or sharing features. Personalization features may include showing you
recommendations while content features include allowing you to share reviews,
ratings, tags, and discussions.
  * Troubleshoot software bugs and operational problems.
* User content and communication: CheaprEats may use content you submit, such as
ratings, comments, or photos, to surface recommendations to other users and to facilitate the
operations of our business. CheaprEats may also allow users to communicate with others on
their team or with Restaurants. These messages, should you choose to participate, may be
accessible by members of your team or Restaurants. CheaprEats may also allow
Restaurants to communicate with users. For example, a Restaurant may contact you directly
if there is a problem with your order.
* Payment Information: When you register as a User, your credit card information is provided
to our payment processing provider, in order to process payments for your orders.
CheaprEats only stores the last four digits of your credit card number, the credit card type,
the expiration number, your postal or zip code and the country. We use this information to
prevent fraud. Information which you supply to our payment processing provider is not within
our control and is subject to the provider's own privacy policy and terms and conditions. We
may change our payment processing providers from time to time and will update this Privacy
Policy to reflect this.
* Research and development: CheaprEats uses your personal information for testing,
research, analysis, and development of our products. This allows us, for our legitimate
interests, to improve our products, improve the in store experience our merchants offer, and
to determine where we should offer or focus our Service. We may share this information with
third parties for industry analysis and statistics.
* Customer support: We use your profile, account, and usage information to assist you when
you contact customer support. This allows us to direct your inquiry appropriately, investigate
and assist you with your inquiry, and follow up to ensure the problem does not persist. We
may also use your information to monitor and improve our customer service responses.
* We may also use your real-time geo-location information to address User or Restaurant
support, technical, or business issues that may arise in the course of your use of the App. If
you contact CheaprEats customer service while an order is in progress, and it is necessary
to use your real-time geo-location information to address your question, our support
personnel will seek your consent before consulting your location.
* Communications from CheaprEats: CheaprEats uses your contact information to
communicate with you about your activity, our services, your account, and, if we have your
prior consent, about CheaprEats news, special offers, and events. We may also contact you
about studies and surveys.
* If you have placed an order through the App, we may send you push notifications to your
mobile phone to let you know the ongoing status of your order. If you do not want to receive
push notifications you can always withdraw your consent by changing your settings via the
settings page of your mobile device.
* If an issue arises while processing your order (e.g. if a restauraunt has run out of chicken
and you ordered jerk chicken), CheaprEats may contact you via text message to alert you to
the issue. Standard text message and data rates may apply. If you wish to stop receiving text
messages from CheaprEats, respond to a text message with the word ‘STOP’.
* We may also need to communicate with you about your account or CheaprEats’s service.
For instance, we may send you an email to verify your username and password or let you
know when our Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance.
* Only where we have your prior consent to do so, CheaprEats may also use your contact
details to send you general updates regarding CheaprEats news, special offers, promotions,
and contests. If you have entered your information into one of our in store devices, we may
follow up with you regarding your inquiry. We may also display tailored advertisements on
third party websites and other platforms. You may opt-out of receiving these updates at any
time by following the instructions in each of our communications.
* CheaprEats rewards: We also use your order information for the purposes of crediting your
CheaprEats Reward account and otherwise administering the loyalty program.
* Public forums: The Website and the App may offer publicly accessible blogs and
community forums. We will use your personal information such as your name, email address,
the messages or content you choose to post to administer and provide you with these
services.
* Security: We may deactivate your account if we suspect that you use our App or Website to
commit fraudulent or illegal acts or if you violate our Terms of Use.
Referral programs
Invitations to Friends & Family:
If you wish to refer friends or family members to CheaprEats, you may share your referral code
individually with those friends or family members.
* CheaprEats does not directly collect any personal information when you share your referral

the referral offer, we will collect your code from them for the purposes of crediting their/your

help to make your online experience faster, and assist with things like personalization, reporting, and
advertising. Cookies are not the only technology that enables this functionality.

information from anyone under the age of 13.
What is our legal basis for processing data?
We will only collect and process personal data about you where we have a lawful basis. Lawful
bases include complying with a legal obligation, consent (where you have given consent to, say,
receive updates and marketing emails), contract (where processing is necessary for the
performance of a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the CheaprEats Services you have requested))
and “legitimate interests”.
We may process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests or for the legitimate
interests of third parties (e.g., your employer or company), provided that such processing shall not
outweigh your rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal data to:

* Enable or administer our business, such as for quality control, consolidated reporting, and
customer service.
* Manage corporate transactions, such as mergers or acquisitions.

* Enable us, Members, and Visitors to connect with each other, find jobs and economic
opportunity, express opinions, exchange information, and conduct business.

your consent at any time and where we rely on legitimate interests, you have the right to object. If
you have any questions about the lawful bases upon which we collect and use your personal data,
please contact our Data Protection Officer at <mailto:hello@cheapreats.com>.

impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that

control over such websites, and therefore we have no responsibility or liability for the manner
in which the organizations that operate such linked websites may collect, use or disclose,
secure and otherwise treat your personal information.

These terms and conditions ("Terms") apply to your use of the CheaprEats website at
<https://cheapreats.com> (the "Website"), the Service and the Application (as defined below), as well
as to all information, recommendations and/or services provided to you on or through the Website,
the Service and the Application.
Please read these Terms carefully before using our website Application or Service. By using or
accessing any part of the Website, Application or ordering products via the Application (whether now
or in the future), you agree to be bound by these Terms. We reserve the right to change these
Terms from time to time by changing them on this page.
The personal information you provide via the Application will be collected, used, managed and
disclose in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
CheaprEats
These Terms are between you and 10792195 Canada Inc. (“CheaprEats”) which is a company
registered in Ontario, Canada with offices located at 256 Doris Avenue, Suite 207, Toronto, ON,
Canada, M2N 6X8. When used in these Terms, the terms “us”, “we” and “our” refer to CheaprEats.
OUR SERVICES
We provide information and a way for you to communicate your orders ("Orders") for products or
services ("Products") from third party restaurants ("Restaurants"), which may be requested through
the use of an application supplied by CheaprEats and downloaded and installed by you on your
single mobile device (smartphone) ("the Application"). All services provided by CheaprEats to you by
means of your use of the Application are hereafter referred to as the "Service".
OUR ROLE
CheaprEats is a platform only to connect you to Restaurants, does not provide the Products or
operate any of the Restaurants, and is not itself a restaurant. The provision of the Product and
fulfilment of any Orders by the Restaurant to you is subject to the agreement (to be) entered into
between you and the Restaurant. CheaprEats shall never be a party to such agreement. It is up to
the Restaurant to accept Orders for Products and services, which may be requested through the use
of the Application or the Service. CheaprEats only acts as an intermediary between you and the
Restaurants, acting as the agent for each Restaurant to arrange and conclude your Orders. When
you pay for an Order on the Application or Service this extinguishes your debt owed to the
Restaurant for that Order.
USING THE APPLICATION OR SERVICE
By using the Application or the Service, you are entering into a contract with CheaprEats under
these Terms. In order to be able to use the Application or Service, you first need to sign-up with
CheaprEats. When signing-up, you are obligated to provide CheaprEats with certain personal
information, including your mobile telephone number and payment card data. Upon successfully
signing-up with CheaprEats, CheaprEats will provide you with a personal account, accessible for you
with a password of your choice.
In connection with your use of the Application and Service, CheaprEats may send you electronic
service messages. These electronic messages may be sent for various reasons, including for
security purposes (e.g. verifying that your smartphone is connected to the phone number you
entered upon registration) and issues related to an Order you placed (e.g. if the Restaurant is out of
stock of an item you ordered, you may be notified by text message). For information about
promotional and marketing messages, please refer to our Privacy Policy.
You have to be at least the age of majority or older in your jurisdiction of residence in order to use
the Service or Application. If you reside in a jurisdiction that restricts the use of the Service or
Application because of your age, or restricts the ability to enter into contracts such as this one due to
age, you must abide by such age limits and you must not use the Service and the Application. You
represent that if you are an individual, you are of the age of majority to enter into a binding contract,
or that if you are registering on behalf of a legal entity, that you are authorized to enter into, and bind
the entity to, these Terms and register for the Service and the Application.
HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION AND SERVICE
The Application allows you to send Orders to Restaurants. The Restaurant has sole and complete
discretion to accept or reject each Order. Once you have submitted your Order and your payment
has been authorized, you will not be entitled to change or cancel your Order, nor will you be entitled
to a refund of your Order. CheaprEats encourages all our Restaurants to accept all Orders and to
communicate any rejection promptly, and CheaprEats will notify you as soon as reasonably
practicable if a Restaurant rejects your Order. Restaurants have the discretion to reject Orders at
any time because they are too busy, due to weather conditions or for any other reason. If the
Restaurant accepts a request, the Application notifies you and provides an estimate on when your
Order will be ready. Neither CheaprEats nor the Restaurant guarantee that Orders will be ready for
pick-up within the estimated times.
If you have any issues with your order, or wish to change or cancel your order, you may contact us
directly (<mailto:hello@cheapreats.com>) and we will assist you in resolving your issue directly with the
Restaurant. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to get in touch with the Restaurant
